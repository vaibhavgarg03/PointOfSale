## Classes

### Checkout.py
### Item.py 

## Data File
inventory.json

## Limitations

1. Since this is a PoS system, it doesn't take care of maintaining stocks or make changes to inventory. It only maintains sales data which can be fed to a stock management system.
2. If the payment method is card, only the name format and the card number is collected and verified. No additional data is collected (like card validity, account balance, etc), as in real world scenarios, a secure payment gateway would be required to do so.
